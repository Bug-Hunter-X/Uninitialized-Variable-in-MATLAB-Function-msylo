This repository demonstrates an example of an uninitialized variable error in MATLAB. The 'bug.m' file contains a function with a potential error where the output variable 'result' is not pre-allocated, and its value depends on conditional logic. This can cause unexpected errors depending on the input and execution path. The 'bugSolution.m' file provides a corrected version of the function.
